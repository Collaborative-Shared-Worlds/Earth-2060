- A scenario for the climate

There are several possible scenarios for the climate. They are described here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Report_on_Emissions_Scenarios

It appears that the chosen scenario will have little impact given the time frame. Changes are inevitable and based on our actual level of carbon emission. It take some time form the CO2 to have an impact, thus even if we go crazy polluting the world, it won't have a large impact by 2050-2060. Real changes can be seen if we look toward the end of the century and it can be catastrophic.

Personally, I opted for the A2 scenario. The complete definitions can be found here, on the last page: http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf
A2 is the second worst scenario, if I understood correctly. I'm not trying to be pessimist, just fatalist. People want cheap energy. Coal is cheap. If you can make cheap clean energy they will use it, otherwise, it's mostly dirty. 
We should not underestimate growth of developing countries, especially in Africa. Maybe it will change but politicians do not have the will or the leadership to face these challenges in time to meet the B1 scenario. 
I could be wrong but given the time frame it doesn't change much.  

- Consequences:

As mentioned earlier, no matter what we do, there will be consequences. 

Some facts:

- Increase in temperature between 1,3 and 1,8 Celsius. 
- Increase in global precipitations. By 2100, the poles will have a massive increase in precipitation. Globally, precipitations increase pretty much everywhere except it the list below. However,  in some places, temperature increase faster than precipitation and cause an increase in aridity. This is oddly the case on the Hudson Bay, Northern Ontario (on some models)
- Concentration of the precipitations: more rain but more concentrated. Most places will have more droughts and more flooding.
- Stronger monsoon in Asia but with drier winters as above.
- More heat waves
- A general decease in diurnal temperature range
- Expansion of the forest in the northern hemisphere
- Ocean acidification problem?
- Sea level: I can't find the source but I think somewhere between 20 and 30 cm?
- Less weak storms (tropical storm) but more power hurricanes 
- Stronger winds in mid latitudes...




- Expansion of the Hadley cell: this is the air cell centered on the equator. It is the motor of air circulation on the planet. As Earth gets warmer, it becomes more powerful and pushes the desert to the north. It reduces the arable land in North Africa, Australia, Mexico, South Africa and Argentina. 
The direct result is a relative expansion of the tropical forests; the Sahel will receive more rain.

Places that will become drier (summary):
- Eastern Brazil 
- Argentina and Chile
- Northern Mexico and some US states
- Mediterranean
- South 
-...

Places that will become more humid
