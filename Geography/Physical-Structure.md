Earth 2060's geography is *very* similar to the current geography of Earth, as expected.

## 1. Continents
Earth is split into 7 continents:

1. North America
2. South America
3. Antarctica
4. Europe
5. Africa
6. Asia
7. Australasia

They are arranged like so:

## 2. Topography
There are several large mountain ranges, including the Alps in south-west Europe, the Himalayas in mid-south Asia, and the Appalachians in eastern North America. The deepest ocean trench is the Mariana trench several hundred miles off the north coast of Australia.
