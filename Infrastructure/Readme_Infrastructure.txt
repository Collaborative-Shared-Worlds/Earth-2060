Use this folder to describe the infrastructure of your world. Infrastructure can range from world-wide (or even universe-wide) infrastructure systems to national or even regional systems, but should be marked (and possibly ordered in folders) to improve readability.

Infrastructure is not only transport of persons. Infrastructure also means transport and distribution of goods, power ect.
