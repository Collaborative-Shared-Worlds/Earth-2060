Use this folder to describe the technology-level and/or magic-level of your world. This can be anything, from already existing technology in settings below the human-tech-level at 2014, extrapolated technic or even totally made up, but should be marked (and possibly ordered in folders) to improve readability.

To keep a certain standard, it would be good to at least have a pseudo-scientific explanation of your tech. See worldbuilding.stackexchange.com for some good examples.
