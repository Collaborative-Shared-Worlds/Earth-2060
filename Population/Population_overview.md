I am working of a xls file for general demographics. It will show the population from 2009 or 2014 depending on the countries to 2060 based on projections of http://populationpyramid.net/zimbabwe/2060/

I also have information about the economy of around 30 countries : their projected GDP.
Economic power in order and size of their GDP in billion in constant USD OF 2014 : China : 77 000, India: 57 000, USA: 52 000, Indonesia: 16 300, Brazil: 11 400, Mexico: 10 200, Nigeria 9200, Russia 8800, Japan 8700, Germany, 7100... 
Based on some projections, India will overtake the US around 2040-2050. 

And their military spending, that is always interesting but my estimates might be wrong. I might put them in another section. In order: USA and China in a tie, India, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, UK, Pakistan, France
